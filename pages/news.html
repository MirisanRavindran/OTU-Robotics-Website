                    The shooter was made with 2 flywheels that were powered by VictorSPX motors. The conveyor was made with a chain belt.
                    The robot proved to be a challenge to make with all the new leads and members, but we were able to make a working robot in the end.
                    We learned a lot building this robot and we had to adapt to overcome these challenges.

                    ACE used to conduct their windtunnel experiments for many companies. We also distributed the kit of parts at the University 
                    of Ontario Tech to allow the High School students to pick them up after they were done watching the kickoff. The students were able to also
                    watch the kickoff on a giant projected screen located inside of the wind tunnel room.

                    and blocks to put in a grid. Our robot was powered by 3 main subsystems, that being the claw, the arm and the elevator.
                    To reach different levels of the grid, we had to use an elevator that was powered by a chain belt. The arm was powered by solenoids
                    to give it a 2 position movement that allowed us to stay within frame before the competition started as per the rules. 
                    The claw was powered by a motor that allowed us to pick up the blocks and cones with ease, provided that our claw had wheels that were 
                    made of a material soft enough to handle the items without breaking.
